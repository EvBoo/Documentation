# About EvBoo
EvBoo is an online booking and administration tool for Scout and Guide events. It is typically used to support events where multiple Groups or Units will attend. It can be used by events with as few as 50 attendees and has been used to manage events with as many as 10,000 attendees.

In addition, EvBoo can also help with the management of international trips, particularly where they come from multiple groups. 

Good examples of events that have benefited from using EvBoo are :

- District or County events for one or more sections such as 
  - Beaver and Rainbow Scout Fundays
  - Cub and Brownie Activity Days
  - Cub and Brownie Weekend Camps
  - Scout and Guide Activity Weekend Camps
  - District / Division Camps all Sections
  - International Camps (international attendees)
  
 - International Trips (visits abroad e.g. District or County trips to Kandersteg International Scout Center)

The documentation for EvBoo is seperated into two sections, one for users of EvBoo, i.e. those individuals attending the event either as a group (participant) or service team or staff team member. The second section is for the Event Management Team, particularly those managing the event and its administration (Event Administrators).
